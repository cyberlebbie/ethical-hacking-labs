Notes

	•	This lab demonstrates how SMB misconfigurations such as null sessions and writable shares can be identified and validated.
	•	The methodology follows an OSCP-style workflow: enumerate → validate → interact.
	•	All testing was conducted in a controlled lab environment using intentionally vulnerable systems.
